About this file
---------------
This file contains some useful information for any plugin developer, and
especially for new plugin developers.


Building your plugin
--------------------
You should first read either `README` or `README.waf` depending on whether
you want to use Autotools or Waf to build the plugins.


Autotools Build System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Autotools build system automatically enables some code checking
utilities, meant to ease tracking of common programming mistakes, or simply
to help making everyone's plugin code better.
They currently are:

* C compiler warnings (can be disabled with the ``--disable-extra-c-warnings``
  configuration flag) -- this test is (obviouly) run during build;
* Static code analysis using ``cppcheck`` (can be disabled with the
  ``--disable-cppcheck`` configuration flag) -- this test is run during
  ``make check``.

These features are only here to help you writing better code: they are not
necessarily and always right -- though they try.
If you think they reports wrong problems, please file a report on the
appropriate place (either the mailing lists or the geany-plugins bug tracker).


Documentation
-------------

README
^^^^^^
Inside each plugin folder, that should be a README located.


Something about the markup being used
#####################################

The README is intended to be written in
`Restructured Text <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_
(as this document is) and therefor should be working e.g. with running
rst2html or similar tools. The reason for is, that these information are
getting used by generating content of http://plugins.geany.org.


Content that shall be in
########################

The documentation should include a minimum on content. This means a
detailed description on features offered by the plugins and usage of
this features. But also it should include some basic information
which is making it easier for the user to get in contact or to find
help in case of any issues.

* author(s) of plugin and its mail addresses
* web pages, if there are any beside of http://plugins.geany.org
* know issues
* bug tracker
* dependencies
