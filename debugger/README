About
=====

Currently supports GDB only, but was developed with multiple debuggers support in mind,
so the other backends support is planned as well.


Features
========

 * Debugger panel
 * Setting target, environment variables and command line arguments
 * Breakpoints
 * Watches, autos
 * Debug terminal
 * Debugger messages window
 * Variables calltips while debugging
 * Saving debug session data in a Geany project (can be switched through settings)
 * Double or single panel modes
 * Hotkeys


Requirements
============
 * Geany >= 0.21
 * GTK 2
 * POSIX API


Usage
=====

Debugger panel behaves in a way similar to other IDE, so an experienced user won't have problems using it.

Panel space can be divided into two notebooks by pressing a button on the right of a panel.

Debug control buttons also reside on the right end of a panel as well as plugin settings dialog button.
A user can also control debug process using hotkeys that are configurable through Geany hotkeys dialog.

When exploring children of a watch or an auto variable user can double click any of them to create a distinct
watch item containing the corresponding expression.
