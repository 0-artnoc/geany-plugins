Debugger plugin
======================

About
-----
Plugin enables debuggers support in Geany.
Aiming on support for various debuggers, for now only
GDB is supported.

Usage
-----
Plugin adds a tab to the lower panel that acts in a similar fashion
like debugger panels found in other IDEs.
In the "Target" tab you can set up a target executable, command-line arguments and
environment variables as well.
Breakpoints tab offers changing existing breakpoints properties (hit count, condition)
enabling/disabling and removing breakpoints.
Adding new breakpoins however can be accomplished by clicking document left margin
as in other IDEs. 
New watch expressions can be added by dragging a variable or an expression from the editor
or by clicking the last line in the watch table.
Target data, breakpoints ans watch expressions can be saved and later loaded using buttons
on the Target tab.
Saving settings creates hidden ".debugger" file in the current directory that contains all information mentioned above.
In order to load your settings navigate to a file from the same folder and press "Load" button from  the "Target" tab.
Other tabs (Locals, Call Stack, Terminal amd Debugger Messages) act like they are supposed to.

Known issues
------------
   * watch expressions that produce long output (containing "..." signs) cause plugin to crash because of parsing error
   * debugger terminal sometimes stops to show any data while real interaction seems to work
